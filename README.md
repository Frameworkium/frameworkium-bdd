Frameworkium-BDD [![Build Status][status-svg]][status]
======================================================

This is a Cucumber implementation of [Frameworkium][frameworkium], it utilises all the features of 
[frameworkium-core][core] with an added BDD layer provided from the Cucumber-JVM framework to give you a BDD Automation solution

## Getting Started

1. Clone this project `git clone https://github.com/Frameworkium/frameworkium-bdd.git`
2. Create your own package for your project under `src/test/java`
3. Add your package to a new `<package>` tag of the `<configuration>` section of the `cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin` 
plugin in the `pom.xml`
```
 <configuration>
   <glue>
     <package>com.your.package</package>
   </glue>
```
4. Create a `glue` package within your project package where you will put all your step definition classes 
5. Create a `pages` package within your project package where you will put your page object classes
6. Create feature files in `src/test/resources/features`
7. Run tests using `mvn clean verify`

## Project Layout

Frameworkium-BDD uses conventional Cucumber-JVM layout as shown below. the main 
package and features package path is already configured within the `pom.xml` so 
that TestNG knows where all the necessary components are when tests are run.

The layout looks something like this

```
.
├── src/
|    ├── test/
|        ├── java/
|        |   └── com.your.package/
|        |       ├── glue/
|        |       |   └──AStepClass.java  
|        |       └── pages/
|        |           └──PageObjectClass.java
|        └── resources/
|            ├── features/
|            |	└── Feature_file.feature
|            └── META-INF/
|                └── aop.xml
└── pom.xml
```

An overview of some of the important packages 

| Package/file  | Description | 
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| glue  | Contain your 'step definition' classes (e.g AStepClass.java) which join together the page object layer with the feature file | 
| pages  | Contain page object classes  | 
| features  | Contain your 'feature files' which hold all your test scenario's  |
| aop.xml | configuration file to tell the allure reporting which packages to include in the report  | 

## Running Tests

### Command Line Options 

See the main [Frameworkium docs](https://frameworkium.github.io/#_pages/Command-Line-Options.md)
for the full list of command line options.
The only addition we have made is adding a `tags` parameter to select the
cucumber tests you to run (this replaces the `tests` and `groups` TestNG parameters used in Frameworkium).

#### Examples

Run all tests with the @ui tag
```
mvn clean verify -Dtags=@ui
```

Run all test that DO NOT have the tag @wip
```
mvn clean verify -Dtags=~@wip
```

Run all test that have the tag @p1 OR @smoke
```
mvn clean verify -Dtags=@p1,@smoke
```

Comprehensive docs on cucumber tagging can be found on the official
[cucumber wiki here](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Tags).

If no tag property is set all tests will be executed.

### API tests

Tag your API Scenarios with the `@api` tag so the correct `BaseAPITest` is
configured, otherwise a browser window will be opened for each test, slowing it down!
This also means you could have UI and API scenario's in the same feature file if you wished.

You can also use one tag at the feature level to create an API runner for all tests in the feature file.

### Parallel Execution 

Parallel execution is available out the box in the same way as shown in the
[Frameworkium docs](https://frameworkium.github.io/#_pages/Command-Line-Options.md).
By passing the `threads` parameter for the amount of tests to run in parallel.
It can also can be configured to use Selenium Grid (*[docs](https://frameworkium.github.io/#_pages/Selenium-Grid.md)*)

We achieve parallel execution by running multiple 'Runner' classes in parallel
with different runner classes executing different tests.
We use the [cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin](https://github.com/temyers/cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin), 
it auto-generates a runner class in the target directory at runtime for each
scenario which will then in turn be run in parallel if you are using selenium grid. 

## Reporting

The Allure reporting used in frameworkium is also used with this framework
generated by running `mvn allure:report`.
See the [main Frameworkium docs](https://frameworkium.github.io/#_pages/Allure-Reporting.md) for more info. 

### Zephyr Integration 

You can also report test results back to zephyr although a different tag is
required from Frameworkium in the format `@TestCaseId(TEST-1)`.
See the main Frameworkium *[docs](https://frameworkium.github.io/#_pages/ZephyrJiraLogging.md)* for more info
